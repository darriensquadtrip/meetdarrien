# Post 9: The Help Article Hack

**Status:** Draft
**Angle:** Tactical/Clever - unexpected use case
**Visuals:** TBD

---

Here's something I didn't expect:

The same AI that tests our product now writes our help articles.

Think about it:

If Claude can navigate our app, click through flows, and take screenshots for testing...

It can do the same thing for documentation.

So I asked it to:
→ Walk through our signup flow
→ Screenshot every step
→ Write a help article explaining the process
→ Embed the screenshots inline

5 minutes later: a complete, accurate support article with real product visuals.

No more:
- Creating test accounts manually
- Taking screenshots one by one
- Writing steps from memory
- Updating docs when the UI changes

It gets better:

Same system now writes marketing emails.

Since Claude has access to our frontend files, it can generate product mockups with real data patterns. Names that look like our users. Numbers that feel realistic.

I used to spend hours building email visuals. Now I describe what I want and it's done.

The unlock:

If AI understands how your product works (for testing), it can explain your product (for support) and show your product (for marketing).

One system. Three outputs.

Stop thinking of AI as a single-use tool. Start thinking of it as compounding leverage.
