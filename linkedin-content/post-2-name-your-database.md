# Post 2: The "Name Your Database" Story

**Status:** Draft
**Angle:** Tactical/Surprising - unexpected blocker to AI adoption
**Visuals:** TBD

---

We couldn't use AI on our codebase.

Not because of the tech. Not because of security. Not because of complexity.

Because nobody could understand our own database.

Our table named "Users"? It actually stored receipts.
Our column named "Status"? It meant five different things depending on the table.

Only two engineers on the team could navigate it. Everyone else just... asked them.

When we tried to use Claude Code, it hallucinated constantly. Made wrong assumptions. Pulled from the wrong tables.

So we did something painful:

We renamed everything.

Every table. Every column. Plain English. So obvious that someone with zero context could understand it.

Took a week. Felt like a waste of time.

Then we ran Claude again.

It worked. No hallucinations. It could navigate the entire system, write queries, build features — because it finally understood what it was looking at.

Here's the thing nobody tells you about AI adoption:

The blocker usually isn't the AI.
It's the mess you've been ignoring for years.

Clean up your systems. Name things clearly. Document the weird stuff.

AI is only as smart as the context you give it.
